# Description 

This is the "rest API" for the chat project. With this application you can chat with other people. Manage your own profile. Sending files to other users.
When a user sends a request to store a message, the API dispatch a "Message Sent" event. These events are broadcast, 
so the front-end application has the ability to listen to these events and allows users to conduct conversations in real time.
